# Bank-with-4-tellers-simulation-
Python

This code simulates a bank with 4 tellers. Tellers one and two deal with general accounts and tellers three and four deal with business accounts. The difference between general and business accounts lies in the distribution of service times. A uniform interarrival time for customers U(2,4) is assumed and 34 percent of customers are business customers. 

There are two versions of the code. In the code BANK.py, the customers choose from the two tellers randomly, disregarding the number of people in line. In the second version of the code, the customers choose the shortest line, otherwise they choose randomly. Customers do not switch lines.
